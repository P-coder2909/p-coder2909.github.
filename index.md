# Hello World!

This is my Home Page! My name is Pablo Beltran and I am a student at [CAl State Fullerton](http://www.fulerton.edu) and my major is Computer Science!

## Computer Science Projects

## CPSC120 

Lab 1

Lab 1 was my favorite because no only was it easy, but it was my first time getting into coding. I understand it was nothing outstanding but it gave me a understanding that going into this major i would have the ability to make amazing things. For example, I would have the abilty to make an animation saying "Happy Birthday, I hope you have a wonderful day." Towards the people I hold most important to me and it gave me motivation to know more about coding.

Lab 6 

Lab 6 part 2 was another of my favorite's because I always wanted to see how a computer had the abilty to find the average of numbers. Having, to do some coding and understanding what goes "behind the certains." blew my mind entirely because it gave me somewhat of a understanding of what a calculator processes so they can give us the average of a number or numbers. It was also a lab that sorta gave me a hard time to understand what I needed to add to get all of the test runs correct.

Lab 5

Lab 5 was my third favorite because it gave me sorta of know about how black jack actually works. The reason why is that my siblings are big fans of playing cards and black jack was one of the main catagories of card game's that they enjoyed playing together, but I was never intrested on playing card games. I mostly found them boring, but now that I have a little knowledge about it. I gained intrest on it and decided to learn more about the game.

 i love computer science.
